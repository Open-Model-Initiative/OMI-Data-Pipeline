## Thanks for contributing to this project!

Welcome to the Open Model Initiative (OMI) repository. The following links are a set of guidelines for contributing to this repo and its packages. While some of these are guidelines, many are requirements that will be enforced by reviewers and automated tests/checks. Use your best judgement to navigate them, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request. 

Contributions come in the form of code submissions, writing documentation, curating data, providing testing/feedback of released code/weights, raising issues, helping others in chat, and any other actions that help develop the broader OMI community.

### Technical Steering Commitee

---

The Technical Steering Committee (the “TSC”) will be responsible for all technical oversight of the open source Project. TSC voting members are initially the Project’s Committers listed below:

- Kent Keirsey - Invoke
- comfyanonymous - Comfy Org
- Justin Maier - Civitai

The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in this file. Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, Discord, or in person.

### Contributors

---

TSC projects generally will involve Contributors and Committers. The TSC may adopt or modify roles so long as the roles are documented in this file.

**Contributor role**

- Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the project
- Commiters are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify (”commit”) source code, documentation, or other technical artifacts in a project’s repository; and
- A Contributor may become a Committer by a majority approval of the existing Committers. A Committer may be removed by a majority approval of the other existing Committers.
