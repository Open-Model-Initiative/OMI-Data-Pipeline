### Reporting a Security Bug

---

If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of the OMI projects or released artifacts, we'd love to hear from you. We will take all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation we will patch it within a reasonable amount of time and release a public security bulletin discussing the impact and credit the discoverer.
