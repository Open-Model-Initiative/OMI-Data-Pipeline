The pipe is attached to a large hopper or funnel that is painted white and has some rust. The hopper is mostly obscured by a metal fence with square holes in it. There is a single plant growing next to the fence, with bright green leaves. The background is a blur of more metal fencing and concrete. The image is a photograph that has been taken from a low angle so that the water seems to be gushing towards the viewer.",
