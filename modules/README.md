# OMI Data-Pipeline: High-Level Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

### Environment Setup

- Set up development, staging, and production environments
- Configure version control (e.g., Git)
- Set up CI/CD pipelines


### Database Setup

- Install and configure PostgreSQL
- Optimize PostgreSQL settings (e.g., shared_buffers)
- Set up database backup and restore procedures


### Backend Framework Setup

- Set up FastAPI project structure
- Configure SQLAlchemy ORM with Alembic for migrations
- Implement basic error handling and logging

Authentication System

- Implement user registration and login
- Set up JWT token-based authentication
