As per section 7.b of the Open Model Initiative (OMI) Charter all code submitted to the OMI needs to be accompanied by a [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) sign-off that is submitted through a TSC-approved contribution process.

The sign off needs to be using your legal name, not a pseudonym. Git has a built-in mechanism to allow this with the `-s` or `--signoff` argument to `git commit` command, providing your `user.name` and `user.email` have been setup correctly.

If you have any questions, you can reach us on the OMI discord; first, join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vANKjzDDkQ) then join the dev-chat channel.
