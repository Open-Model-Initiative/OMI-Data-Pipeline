This guide is intended to help prospective contributors get setup and oriented with the project and its codebase.

Anyone is able to contribute to the OMI project!

Wait, I just want to help with data/annotations/etc.
----------------------------------------------------

That's great and we look forward to your help!

Our hosted data environment where you'll be able to shared data, annotations, rate images, etc. is not yet available.

In the meantime, you can share datasets in the `Datasets` forum channel in the OMI `Discord server <https://discord.gg/vANKjzDDkQ>`_

(Which is also where we'd announce once the hosted data environment is available!)
